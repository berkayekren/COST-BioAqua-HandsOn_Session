# CA22160 - Enhancing knowledge of BIOmolecular solutions for the well-being of European AQUAculture sector (BIOAQUA) 

## BIOAQUA COST CA22106 - Microbiome Day-2 Hands-On Session (2025-10-21)

### Overview
This repository contains materials and resources for the hands-on session on microbiome analysis as part of the BIOAQUA COST Action CA22106. The session focuses on practical applications of microbiome data in aquatic environments.

### Session Details
- **Date**: October 21, 2025
- **Time**: 13:45 - 17:15
- **Location**: TUBITAK Gebze Campus

### Program
The hands-on session is divided into three subsessions:

1. **Microbiome and Machine Learning** (13:45 - 15:00)  
    Introduction to applying machine learning techniques to microbiome datasets, including data preprocessing and model training.

2. **Microbiome and Deep Learning** (15:15 - 16:15)  
    Hands-on exploration of deep learning methods for microbiome analysis, such as neural networks for classification and prediction.

3. **Functional Analysis** (16:30 - 17:15)  
    Practical session on functional annotation and analysis of microbiome data, including tools for pathway analysis and metabolic profiling.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of R/Python programming.
- Familiarity with microbiome data formats (e.g., OTU tables, FASTA files).
- Required software:
    - For machine and deep learning sessions:
        - A supported IDE (needed for scripts)
        - Jupyter Notebook or VSCode(ium)
        - Python 3 and its libraries

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/berkayekren/COST-BioAqua-HandsOn_Session.git`
2. Install dependencies:
    - conda environment (Anaconda, miniconda or mamba environment)
3. Follow the notebooks/scripts in the respective subsession folders.
